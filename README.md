Implemented following algorithms to solve the problem- Logistic Regression (with Lasso penalty), SVM (with linear and RBF kernels) and Random Forest (with 100 decision trees and Entropy & Gini impurity). Also used Grid Search to tune hyperparameters of Random Forest classifier. Achieved initial test accuracy of 56.2% with Logistic Regression and increased to 63.5% with Random Forest + Gini impurity.
